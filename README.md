# Passive Illustration Website Repository

The **Passive Illustration** website is a project that explores the possibilities of **latent space** as a creative medium. In my master thesis I delved into the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity, investigating how generative algorithms—especially such as Stable Diffusion—transform the traditional roles of artist and machine. The website provides access to interactive elements, images, and documentation generated from my experiments in latent space.

## Purpose of the Experiment

As an illustrator and researcher, I am interested in how AI's latent space can serve as a “meta-creative medium.” This experiment examines **computational creativity** and challenges established boundaries between human intention and machine generation. By manipulating AI parameters and curation techniques, I investigate how much the creative process can be automated and, conversely, where human oversight is essential.

The central aim is to explore **AI as a collaborative partner** rather than merely a tool. In my work, I have observed that AI-driven processes can produce unique visual outputs, sparking a dialogue between human and machine-generated creativity. The results of this experiment demonstrate both the capabilities and limitations of latent space in crafting art that is unique, interpretive, and sometimes unexpected. Through this exploration, I hope to inspire others to rethink what it means to "create" in the digital age.

## Repository Structure

- **/public/pdf**: Contains documentation and theoretical insights on latent space and computational creativity (the theortical master thesis)
- **/scripts**: Contains scripts used for displaying the results, as I work with JSON files for easier maintainance and update.
- **/public**: All website files that display the images and descriptions from this project.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` to explore the experiments firsthand. Each section of the website showcases specific aspects of AI-generated art and the ways latent space can be systematically navigated to produce unique, multi-layered visuals.

Feel free to use the code and resources in this repository as a starting point for your own exploration into AI and creativity.
